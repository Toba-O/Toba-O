I'm a student, front end (aspiring full stack) web developer, bioinformatics enthusiast, and avid learner!
I work with a variety of technologies and languages, such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, Java, Python, and R!

I’m currently working on EarlyBird, an early onset lung cancer detection software, alongside a few web development projects and frequent contributions to open source projects. I’m also learning full stack web development and design alongside bioinformatics/computational biology

<br>
From the start of 2021, I had a goal to make a contribution every day. So far, I've missed: <b> 1 </b>

* **EDIT April 19:** For some reason, Github is being a little odd and displaying a hole on January 12. However, rest assured, there were 3 contributions made that day
