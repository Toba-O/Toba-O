I'm a student, full stack web developer and designer, bioinformatics enthusiast, and avid learner!
I work with a variety of technologies and languages, such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, Java, Python, and R!

I’m currently working on EarlyBird, an early onset lung cancer detection software, alongside a few web development projects and frequent contributions to open source projects. I’m also learning full stack web development and design alongside bioinformatics/computational biology

<br>
From the start of 2021, I had a goal to make a contribution every day. <em>I believe it's going well</em>
